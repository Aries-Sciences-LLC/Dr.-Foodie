This an iOS app that is designed to be a seamless tool for anyone interested in making sure that they eat the best they can for their body. It works with iCloud and the Health app to be personally tuned and work best to the user's body. It works as both a calendar for the user's day-to-day meals, a map to suggest the best possible places for them to get the most nutrients, and a data section to show them what they need to eat and how much for the rest of the day.

That's really all you have to do, snap a picture! Because our speedy Gonzalez AI predicts which food your eating and then asynchronously gets the nutrition data for your food.

You get a preview of the nutrition you'll be eating and then tuck it away into your personal food journal for you to retrieve and look back to whenever you desire.

When you get hungry the AI looks through what you have eaten and recommends locally owned, organic, and healthy businesses that it knows you will love.

Most important of all, the AI presents you with the hard facts and a fast, concise summary of what the doctors recommend and what you should do.
